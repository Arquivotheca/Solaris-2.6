:panel
This window allows you to clean up your
missing media problem.  An i/o operation
was attempted on the specified volume
which is no longer available. Most likely
this happened when you manually removed 
the media.

In the future, use the filemgr's "Eject Disk"
button or use the "eject" command to remove 
the media. Proper ejection of managed media 
allows volume management to clean up after
itself and avoid missing media problems.
#

:ok
Click the "OK" button once you have inserted
the missing media into a system drive. This
will cause the "volcheck" command to be run
and complete the pending i/o transaction. Then
volume management will be returned to an error
free state.
#

:cancel
Clicking the "Cancel" button causes the 
"volcancel" command to run which terminates the 
pending i/o transaction.

Once this is done it is a good idea for you to 
return the missing media to a drive and run the
"volcheck" command. "volcheck" can be run from
the command line or by selecting the
"Check For Floppy" command from the filemgr's
FILE menu.
