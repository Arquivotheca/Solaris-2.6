README for the 4.1.3 double super secret un-stub things that go
	onto a 5.1* CD.

------------------------------------------

into each karch's install root, go:
-----------------------------------
.stub.4x.size		- file of the size of a cpio'd stub
.stub.4x.cpio		- list of files to cpio onto a system for stub
.stub.4x.part2		- shell script that does the stub action

Source: 		Result
------------------------------
.stub.4x.size		.stub.4x.size
.stub.4x.cpio		.stub.4x.cpio
.stub.4x.part2.sh	.stub.4x.part2


NOTE: .stub.4x.cpio and .stub.4x.size are data files, so no embedded
	SCCS/comments are allowed in them.

NOTE: for now, .stub.4x.cpio and .stub.4x.size have dummy contents,
	but they are required so that the command hidden in 4.1.3
	can determine it has the right media mounted.
	(I'll make some effort to fix things, but 4.1.3 is almost
		out the door)

TODO:
-----
(_)	find a nice source home for these files
	(Makefile fragment below)

(_)	whatever is needed to deliver these files are delivered in SUNWcdrom.
	(from where they are just pgkadd'd to each karch's install root.
