---- About This Screen -----------------------------

This screen lets you change the constraints on file
systems. The constraints tell auto-layout what it 
can or cannot do to a file system when it tries to 
reallocate space again. 

The main task when changing constraints is to make 
enough free space available from the file systems 
listed for the file systems that need more space 
(Total Space Allocated > Total Space Needed).

    NOTE: Even though you may specify constraints 
    to allocate enough free space for the space 
    needed, auto-layout may still fail because of 
    limitations on how the file systems can be 
    reallocated. 
 
---- Constraints -----------------------------------

You can specify the following constraints for a file
system:

> Fixed - Auto-layout cannot change the file system.
  By default, all file systems that don't require 
  more space are specified as Fixed.

> Changeable - Auto-layout can move the file system
  to another location and it can change its size. 
  This constraint is available only for file systems
  that are mounted by the /etc/vfstab file. You can
  change a file system's size by changing its 
  Minimum Size value. 

    NOTE: File systems that require more space are 
    always specified as Changeable. 

> Movable - Auto-layout can move the file system to
  another slice (on the same disk or different 
  disk), but its size stays the same. This 
  constraint is available only for file systems that
  are mounted by the /etc/vfstab file.

> Available - Auto-layout will use all of the space
  on the file system to reallocate space (all of the
  file system's space is considered free space 
  because it's not mounted by the /etc/vfstab file).

  All the data in the file system will be lost. 
  This constraint is available only on file systems
  that are not mounted by the /etc/vfstab file.

---- Guidelines for Specifying Constraints ---------

> On file systems that reside on the same disk as a 
  file system that needs more space, specify the 
  Changeable or Movable constraint (Choose the file
  systems that reside next to the file system 
  first.)

> On file systems that can spare free space, specify
  the Changeable constraint. 
 
> On file systems that contain data that you don't 
  need or want, specify the Available constraint.

> Try to minimize the use of the Changeable and 
  Movable constraints. If a file system is 
  moved or changed, its user files must be backed 
  up during the upgrade so the disks can be 
  repartitioned (client services and Solaris CD 
  images are considered user files).

---- Heading Descriptions ------------------------

> Required Size - The size that the file system 
  requires for the upgrade.
 
> Existing Size - The current size of the file
  system. 
 
> Free Space - The amount of free space that the 
  file system contains. 
 
> Space Needed - The amount of additional space 
  that a file system needs for the upgrade.  
 
> Minimum Size - The minimum size the file system 
  will be after the upgrade. The size of the file 
  system may be more if unallocated space is added 
  to it. You can increase or decrease this value to 
  change the size of a file system when the 
  Changeable constraint is specified.  
 
> Total Space Needed - The total amount of needed 
  space on all the file systems.
 
> Total Free Space Allocated - The total amount of 
  free space that is selected.  This includes free 
  space from file systems marked as Available
  (Free Space) and from file systems marked as
  Changeable (Existing Size - Minimum Size).

---- Collapse Option -------------------------------

The Collapse option enables you to decrease the
number of file systems by moving (collapsing) them 
into their parent file systems. Collapsing file 
systems may or may not change which file systems 
need more space for the upgrade. 

---- Filter Option ---------------------------------

The Filter option enables you to select which file 
systems to display in the list.

---- Defaults Option -------------------------------

The Defaults option resets all the constraints to 
their default values: file systems that need more 
space are Changeable and all other file systems are 
Fixed.
