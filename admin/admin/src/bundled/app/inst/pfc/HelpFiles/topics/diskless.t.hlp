---- Serving diskless clients ------------------------------

To support diskless clients, an /export/root file
system is automatically created when Solaris is
installed on a server. However, you must set aside
disk space for each client's (/) root file system
and swap files.

---- Set up for diskless clients --------------------------

Solstice Host Manager should be used to set up diskless
client (/) root and swap before installing Solaris on the
server. When the server installs Solaris, the client's root
file system gets installed under /export/root, and the
client's swap gets installed under /export/swap.

---- Server file systems and directories ------------------
  
  /export - a file system on a server that is
            shared with other systems on a
            network. Diskless clients rely on
            /export on a file server to boot
            and run.

  /export/root - a directory for client root
                 directories

  /export/swap - a directory for client swap
                 files

  /export/exec - a directory to store complete
                 /usr file systems for clients
                 whose architectures are different
                 from the server's
