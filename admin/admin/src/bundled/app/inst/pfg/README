INCLUDE FILES

The following file(s) need to be moved in the inst/apps avocet tree

	cp inst/apps/libsrc/disk/disk_def.h  inst/apps/include

	(necessary for compiling pfinstall, which currently look
		in libsrc dirs)



DIFFS

Some functionality of pfinstall was changed or dropped from pfgui

1.  "-d" comline arg changed to "-v" since the former conflicts with
	the Xt argv parser.   It sees -d as -display.

2.  rootdisk dropped as comline arg.  judgement call, it's really 
	not too useful, only there for debugging, right?

3.  the disk lib sets a trap for SEGV in the load_disk() routine, but
	does not return to the old sig handler when done.  Fix?
