---- Heterogeneous servers ---------------------------

Heterogeneous servers are servers that support 
clients of different platforms (for example,
SUNW,Sun_4_60, i86pc, prep). During the Solaris 
installation program, you can allocate space for 
file systems on the disk, but the clients are not 
completely set up until you use Solstice Host 
Manager after you install Solaris software. 

If the client is an X86 system, platform support 
must be set up using Software Manager tool after 
Solaris software is installed.
