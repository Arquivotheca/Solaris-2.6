----- Allocating client services -------------

The Solaris installation program lets you
allocate space for AutoClient systems and 
diskless clients. After you install Solaris 
software, you must use Solstice Host Manager 
to set up client service support for these 
clients or they will not be able to access 
Solaris software.
