---- Software Groups -------------------------------

Solaris has four software groups:

   Core - contains the minimum software required to
   boot and run Solaris on a system. It includes
   some networking software, and the drivers
   required to run the OpenWindows environment; it
   does not include the OpenWindows software. 

   End User - contains the Core software plus the
   recommended software for an end user including
   OpenWindows and DeskSet software.

   Developer - contains the End User software plus
   libraries, include files, man pages, and 
   programming tools for developing software. 
   Compilers and debuggers are not included with
   Solaris.

   Entire Distribution - contains the entire Solaris
   release.

A fifth software group may be displayed (SPARC only):

   Entire Distribution Plus OEM Support - contains
   the entire Solaris release, plus software to
   support specific vendor hardware. This group 
   is recommended when installing Solaris software 
   on SPARC-based servers.

Only one software group can be selected at a time.

---- Recommended Size of Software Groups -----------
 
The Recommended Size for installing each software
group is displayed in megabytes opposite each group.
This size reflects:

    - Size of the software
   
    - File system overhead

    - Swap (which varies with the amount of memory)

NOTE: Once you layout the disk (manually or via 
auto-layout, the values listed in the Recommended 
and Minimum fields may change.
