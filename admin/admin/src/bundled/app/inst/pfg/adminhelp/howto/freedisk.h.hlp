---- To free up disk space --------------------

There are several ways to free up disk space:

- Add more disks to the Selected Disk list on the
  Disks screen 

- Attach another disk to your system

- Remove a software cluster or package from the
  software group you've selected (see Customizing
  Software screen)

- Choose a different software group on the Software 
  screen

- If installing a server, you can reduce the
  number of clients and the default swap space
  per client
