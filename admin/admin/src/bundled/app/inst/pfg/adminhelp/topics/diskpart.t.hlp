---- Definition: File system and disk layout ----

File system and disk layout is the process of laying
out file systems across the disks you've selected
for installing Solaris. A disk can be divided into a
maximum of eight slices. You can assign file systems
to slices across the disks which determines where
slices will be mounted in the files system hierarchy
when the system is running.

You can choose to have the software lay out the file
systems (auto-layout), or you can manually assign a
file systems to disks.

---- Important Solaris file systems -----------

The following file systems are ones that the Solaris
installation program tracks for sufficient disk
space as they are crucial to the success of 
installing Solaris:

/ (root) - the file system at the top of the
hierarchical file tree on a system. It contains
the directories and files critical for system
operation, such as the kernel, device drivers,
and the programs for booting a system.
           
/var - a file system that contains system files
directories that are likely to change and grow over
the life of the local system. These include system
logs, vi files, mail files, and uucp files.

/usr - a file system on a standalone system or
server that contains many of the standard UNIX 
programs. Sharing the large /usr file system
with a server rather than maintaining a local copy
minimizes the overall disk space required to 
install and run the Solaris software on a system.

/usr/openwin - a directory on a standalone system or
server that contains OpenWindows file systems. If
you do not create this directory, the Solaris
installation program puts these file systems in
/usr.

/export - a file system on a server that is shared
with other systems on a network. For example, the
/export file system can contain the root file system
and swap for diskless clients and the home
directories for users on the network. Diskless 
clients rely on the /export file system on a file
server to boot and run.

/export/root - a directory for clients' root file
systems.

---- Guidelines -------------------------------

Which file systems should be created and their size,
depends on the intended role of the system. For
example, the file system hierarchies are usually
more complex for servers than for standalone systems. 
How file systems are laid out are also influenced by:
 
  - Third-party or unbundled software to be
    installed

  - Whether a printer will be connected to the
    system

  - Whether users' home directories will be on a
    local disk, or mounted from a shared file
    server

  - Where electronic mail will be received

  - Site backup policies

A general guideline is to divide up the file system
hierarchy into distinct file systems. This makes
backing up and restoring more efficient because not
all parts of the hierarchy require backup on a 
regular basis. By dividing file systems you can also
spread the file system hierarchy across one or more
disks, which can improve performance. For example,
almost all of Solaris gets loaded into the /usr file
system. Because the operating files of Solaris are
mostly read-only, you can put /usr files into a 
separate file system and back them up once.

---- Creating / (root) as the only file system -----

While it is acceptable to create (/) root as the
only file system, backing up and restoring becomes
more time-consuming because backups and recoveries
are done for an entire file system.
