Toggles program mode from installation to removal and vice versa.  The two modes are:
 
  Install
 
    Select this mode if you wish to install soft-
    ware.  You will need to specify the location
    of a software distribution, either by using
    the Props button and Source Media category, or
    by specifying an initial directory with the
    command-line option "-d."  Use the software
    selection area at the bottom of the window to
    select modules to be installed, then press the
    Apply button to initiate the installation(s).
 
  Remove
 
    Select this mode if you wish to remove
    software.  After pressing this button, the
    software selection area at the bottom of the

    you wish to remove, then press the Apply
    button to initiate the removal(s).

# 
:BaseFile
File Button
 
Enables you to save the current program properties to a configuration file.  The File menu contains the following commands:
 
  Save
 
    Use this command if you wish to save the
    current configuration to a file, the name
    of which you specified either on the command
    line via the "-c" option, or with a previous
    "Save As" operation.
 
  Save As...
 
    Use this command if you wish to specify the
    name of the file to which current program
    properties are to be saved.

# 
:BaseView
View Button
 
Displays various pop-up windows and the previous level in the software selection display.  The View menu contains the following commands:
 
  Prev Level
 
    Use this command once you have expanded a
    software cluster in either the software
    selection or level display windows.
    Returning to the previous level enables you
    to view and select the modules contained in
    the cluster you most recently expanded.
 
  Command Window...
 
    Use this command to display the window in
    which swmtool executes programs (the most
    important of which are "pkgadd" and "pkgrm,"
    the package installation and removal commands.
 
  Space Meter...
 
    Use this command to display a graphical
    representation of the space available on
    your file systems.

# 
:BaseEdit
Edit Button
 
Enables you edit either the native environment or a client support service and
enables selection or deselection of groups of software modules within those environments.  The Edit menu contains the following commands:
 
  Native Environment
 
    Use this command if you wish to select
    software to be installed or removed from
    the set of software used by this [local]
    machine.  This mode is used for almost
    all operations on unbundled software.
 
  Add Client Support...
 
    Use this command if you wish to add
    support [services] for diskless clients.

  Select All
 
    Selects all modules matching the current
    category for either installation or removal,
    depending on the current mode.
 
  Deselect All
 
    Deselects all modules selected for instal-
    lation or removal, depending on the current
    mode.  Note that the semantics of De-select
    All differ slightly from those of Select
    All; deselection operates on all modules,
    visible or not, whereas selection operates
    only on modules matching the current category.

# 
:BaseProps
Props Button
 
Edit the various configurable properties of swmtool.  The Props button displays a pop-up window that provides access to the following groups of properties:
 
  Source Media
 
    The properties accessible from this panel
    enable you to specify the software distri-
    bution you wish to browse.
 
  Package Administration
 
    Properties grouped under this category
    control the actions of the commands "pkgadd"
    and "pkgrm."  Most of these properties match
    parameters specified in the packaging
    commands' admin(4) file.
 
  Current Product Category
 
    This property enables you to select a
    "category" to which software modules must
    belong in order for them to be displayed in
    the software selection portion of the window.
 
  Browser Display
 
    The properties accessible from this panel
    enable you to control the display format of
    the software selection area.
 
  Remote Hosts
 
    This property enables you to specify hosts
    other than the local host on which you wish
    install or remove packages.

# 
:BaseDoit
Apply Button
 
Initiates installation or removal of selected software modules.
 
  This button is activated once you have selected
  software to be either installed or removed,
  depending on the program's current mode.  If
  you have not selected any software modules, the
  button will be rendered inactive (grayed out).

# 
:BaseCat
Category
 
Indicates to what category software must belong in order to be displayed in the software selection area.
 
  The default category "All Software" matches
  all software products.  To change categories
  (and thus limit the number of modules displayed),
  use the Categories... command from the View menu.

# 
:Levels
Level Display
 
Indicates current position in software distribution cluster hierarchy and enables rapid traversal among displayed levels.
 
  Software distributions can be composed of
  packages and clusters, where clusters can
  contain groups of packages or other clusters.
  The resulting tree-like hierarchy facilitates
  rapid selection of groups of modules.  You
  may "expand" clusters to view or select their
  individual components.  As you expand a
  cluster, you descend to a new level of the
  distribution's hierarchy.

  Each such level is represented in the level
  display by a box and the name of the level.  The
  level display represents the branch through the
  cluster hierarchy you most recently traversed.
  You may use this display to return to any pre-
  viously-visited level by pressing the SELECT
  mouse button once while the cursor is over the
  box representing the desired level.

# 
:Mods
Software Selection Display

Represents software in the current distribution and enables selection for either installation or removal.

  In the bottom area of the window, swmtool
  displays the software modules found in the
  currently-active software distribution.
  The format of this display is controlled by
  the program's display properties.  You may
  limit the number of modules displayed by
  using the Categories... command in the View
  menu to set the current software category.

  Each module icon's border indicates whether
  any version of that module is currently
  installed on the local system.  There are
  three possible border types:

    None

	No border indicates no version of the
	module is installed on the local system.

    Solid

	A solid border around a module's icon
	indicates that the version of the module
	being examined is already installed on
	the local system.

    Broken

	A broken or dashed border around the
	icon indicates a version different from
	that being examined is installed.

  To select a module for installation or removal,
  position the cursor anywhere over the desired
  module and press the mouse SELECT button once.
  Selected items will appear in reverse video.
  Pressing SELECT over the item again removes
  the module from the installation or removal
  list.

  Pressing the MENU button while positioned over
  a module displays the module's menu.  This menu
  contains the following commands, some of which
  may not be active (i.e., grayed-out), depending
  on the module's type:

    Package Properties...

	Use this command to display a pop-up
	window containing additional statistics
	describing the module.

	If you are installing a package, this
	window enables you to specify the direc-
	tory in which the module should be rooted.
	If the module is a cluster, all its com-
	ponents will also be installed relative to
	this root directory.

    Product Properties...

	Use this command to display a pop-up
	window specifying product-level
	properties.  Currently there are two:
	support for multiple architectures and
	multiple localizations.

    Read About

	If active, drag the mouse to the right
	of this command to display a menu
	containing additional textual descriptions
	of the module.

    Run

	If active, drag the mouse to the right
	of this command to display a menu
	containing the names of executable
	demonstrations of the module,

    Expand

	If active, use this command to "expand" a
	cluster, enabling you to view and select
	the individual components.

  Double clicking the SELECT button while posi-
  tioned over a module executes the default module
  menu action.  By default, this action displays
  the package property sheet associated with the
  module.  You may change the default by bringing
  up the module menu, positioning the cursor over
  the desired menu item, then pressing and
  releasing the "Control" key.

:MeterCtrl
Space Meter

Indicates required and available disk space per file system.

  The Space Meter provides an indication of the
  amount of disk space required to install the
  selected software or that would become available
  after removing selected software.  It is auto-
  matically displayed the first time you select a
  software module for which there is insufficient
  disk space.  The columns in the meter are as
  follows:

    File System:

	The first column is a mount point name.
	Swmtool tracks several possible mount
	points and calculates space totals for
	those which correspond to actual mount
	points on your system.  Names which are
	not mount points are grayed-out.

    Percentage Used:
	
	The second column graphically represents
	the combined percentage of disk space used
	and disk space required to install
	selected software.

    Mb Used:

	The third column is the total, in
	Megabytes, of the amount of disk space
	currently in use plus that required to
	install selected software.

    Mb Free:

	The last column indicates the amount of
	space, in Megabytes, that would remain in
	each file system after installation of any
	selected software.  A negative value indi-
	cates the program estimates insufficient
	space is available for the selected
	software and requires corrective action.

  If you do not have enough space on a file system
  to install all selected software modules, you
  might consider some or all of the following
  options:  select fewer software modules for
  installation, change the installation directory
  for some or all selected software, increase the
  amount of space allocated to the file system
  in question, or use symbolic links or new
  partitions to move the installation directory
  to a different file system.

# 
:MeterDismiss
Dismiss Button

Dismisses the Space Meter window from view.

  Alternatively, you may remove the push-pin from
  the window's frame, or use the window manager's
  Window menu and the Dismiss command.  These
  procedures are window-manager dependent; consult
  the documentation supplied with your window
  manager if you are not using olwm.

# 
:DispIconic
Display Format
 
Specifies representation of software modules in the software selection display.  The available formats are:
 
  Automatic
 
    If your vendor supplied any of the modules in
    the current display an icon, all modules are
    displayed primarily as icons.  If in this
    format any particular module does not have an
    icon, a generic icon is used.  If no modules
    have icons, all modules are primarily dis-
    played as text, with a small generic icon
    representing each module's type.  This mode is
    the default.
 
  Iconic
 
    Use this mode to force all modules to be
    displayed as icons.  If no icon is explicitly
    associated with a module, a generic icon is
    used.
 
  Textual
 
     Use this mode to force representation of
     modules primarily as names.  Each name is
     accompanied by a small generic icon that
     denotes the module's type (individual package
     or cluster) and an indication of the total
     amount of disk space required to install the
     module.

# 
:DispName
Name Length
 
Specifies the format of module names in the software selection area.  The two formats are as follows:
 
  Long
 
    Use this format to display the full name
    of each module.
 
  Short
 
    Use this format to display the abbreviated
    name of each module.  This format is useful
    if using multiple columns.

# 
:DispCols
Number of Columns
 
Specifies the number of columns used in textual mode.

# 
:DispApply

  guration file (if you have not yet applied any
  changes).

# 
:LoadCtrl
Source Media Control Panel
 
  For more detailed information about a specific
  control, use the mouse to position the cursor
  over the control of interest, then press the
  "Help" key.

# 
:LoadType
Media Type
 
Specifies the physical format of the software distribution you intend to examine.  Currently, swmtool supports the following software distribution formats:
 
  Local CD-ROM
 
    Use this setting if you intend to examine a
    software distribution from a locally-attached
    CD-ROM device and have not yet mounted it as
    a local file system.
 
    This option will not work with devices
    controlled through volume management; use the
    Mounted Directory option instead.
 
  Mounted Directory
 
    Use this setting if your software distribution
    has already been locally mounted.  If your
    software is CD-based and you do not have a
    local CD-ROM device, you will need to use this
    setting and mount the disk manually using NFS.

# 
:LoadEject
Eject Button
 
Ejects a Compact Disk from the specified device.
 
  To eject a compact disk, choose the media type
  CD-ROM, enter the name of the device in the
  Device Name field, then press the Eject button.

# 
:LoadDev
Device Name
 
Specifies the name of the device containing the software distribution.
 
  Use this field if you indicated your software
  is CD-based.  For a standard, local CD-ROM
  device, the default device, "/dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0",
  should suffice.  The device name you specify
  must not be mounted or must have been mounted
  from within swmtool.  Consult the documentation
  included with your product distribution for
  further information.

# 
:LoadDir
Directory Name
 
Specifies the name of the directory on which your software distribution should be mounted (Local CD-ROM) or the location of a mounted software distribution (Mounted Directory).
 
  If you indicated your software is CD-based,
  this value specifies the directory on which
  the CD-ROM device should be mounted.  This
  directory does not need to exist; swmtool will
  create it for you if you desire.  The directory
  name you specify must not be a mount point or
  must correspond to a mount point used within
  swmtool.
 
  If you indicated your software is already
  mounted, use this field to enter the path name
  of the distribution.  This path can be relative;
  however, swmtool does not recognize the home
  directory expansion character, tilde "~").
  Typing "Return" after entering your text causes
  the program to begin the load operation.

# 
:LoadApply
Apply Button
 
Makes a software distribution available for installation.
 
  When you are ready to start examining a software
  distribution, press the Apply button.  If your
  distribution format is an unmounted CD-ROM, the
  program will attempt to mount the CD using the
  device name and mount point parameters you
  specified.  After mounting, or if you specified
  a mounted file system format, the distribution
  is examined for available software.

  Ask
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to prompt you before attempting to
    install a package that has already been
    installed (this check is based on package
    name).
 
  Overwrite
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to install packages in place of any
    previous installations.  Note that you are
    only allowed to re-install the package "on
    top" of the old one.  You are not allowed to
    install the package in a different location.
 
  Install Unique
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to install packages as uniquely-
    named instances, should they be installed
    already.  Note that this option may overwrite
    existing files.  This option is useful if you
    are installing packages that are architecture-
    or locale-specific pieces of a product, or you
    wish to install a new version of a previously-
    installed package in a different location.
 
  Abort
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to abort without making any changes
    to the system should you attempt to install
    a package more than once.

# 
:ConfigPartial
Existing Partial Installation
 
Controls attempts to re-install a partially-installed package.  The options are as follows:
 
  Ask
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to prompt you before attempting to
    re-install a partially-installed package.
 
  Ignore
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to ignore previous attempts to
    install the package, overwriting any previous
    partial installations.
 
  Abort
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to abort if it detects a previous
    partial installation.  In this case, it will
    not make any changes to the system.

# 
:ConfigSetuid

Controls attempts to install files with set-ID bits activated.  The options are as follows:
 
  Ask
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to prompt you before installing a
    file with setuid or setgid bits activated.
 
  Yes
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to install files regardless of the
    states of their setuid and setgid bits.
 
  No
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to install setuid and setgid files
    with their setuid and setgid bits turned off.
 
  Abort
 
    Use this option if you would like the package
    software to abort without making any changes
    to the system if it detects an attempt to
    install setuid or setgid files.

# 
:ConfigAction
Run Setuid/Setgid Scripts
 
Controls attempts to run scripts with set-ID bits activated.  The options are as follows:
 
  Ask
 
    Some packages contain scripts to be executed
    after the package is installed or removed.
    These "action" scripts potentially impact
    system security if their setuid or setgid bits
    are enabled.  Use the Ask option if you would
    like the package software to prompt you before
    executing a setuid or setgid action script.

# 
:HostEdit
Edit Button

Controls the contents of the target host list.  The Edit button provides access to a menu containing the following commands:

  Add Entry

    Creates a new target host entry initialized
    from the contents of the Host Name and Root
    Password fields.  The command's pull-right
    sub-menu controls where in the list the new
    entry is created (at the top, the bottom,
    before or after the currently-selected
    entry).

    By default, pressing SELECT on the Edit
    button adds a new host entry to the end of
    the list.

    Note that hosts are not marked as selected
    for installation and removal by default;
    this is accomplished by using the Toggle
    Selection button.

  Modify Entry

    Replaces the name and password associated
    with the currently-selected host entry with
    the values of the Host Name and Root Password
    fields.

  Delete Entry

    Removes the currently-selected entry from
    the list of target hosts.

  When ready to commit your changes, press the
  Apply button.

# 
:HostList
Host List
 
Lists hosts on which software can be installed or removed.
 
  The target host list specifies hosts on which
  swmtool can install or remove software.  Each
  list entry contains three fields:  a glyph
  indicating the host's system status (up, down,
  requires a root password, or unknown), its name,
  and its selection status.

  Pressing SELECT while positioned over one of
  the entries in the list makes that entry the
  current selection and the target of subsequent
  Edit and Toggle Selection commands.

  For information about adding, removing, or
  modifying host entries, press the "Help" key
  while the cursor is positioned over the Edit
  button.

  For information about changing a host's
  selection status, press the "Help" key while
  positioned over the Toggle Selection button.

# 
:HostToggle
Toggle Selection

Toggles the selection status of the currently-selected host.

  To enable software installation and removal
  on a host, mark it as SELECTED by following
  these steps:

    1) Position the cursor over the entry corres-
      ponding to the host you wish to select and
      press the SELECT mouse button.

    2) Press the Toggle Selection button.

    3) Press Apply to commit your selection(s).

  For information about adding, removing, and
  modifying host entries, press the "Help" key
  while the cursor is positioned over the Edit
  button.

# 
:HostName
Host Name
 
Specifies the name of a new host.
 
  Use this field in conjunction with the Add and
  Change buttons to add and modify host entries,
  respectively.

# 
:HostPwdClear
Clear Button

Clears the existing value in the Root Password field.

  To guard against eavesdropping, root passwords
  are not echoed in the Root Password field.
  The Clear button provides both an indication
  that the Root Password field is non-empty and
  the means to erase the field's value.  Pressing
  this button clears the field and de-activates
  the button.  The button will be re-activated
  when you enter a value in the Password field.

# 
:HostPwd
Root Password:
 
Specifies the root password for a host.
 
  In order to execute programs on remote systems,
  swmtool requires either a .rhosts entry on the
  remote system permitting unrestricted root
  access from this system, or that you know the
  remote system's root password.  If a root
  password is required, you will be notified
  by pop-up notices and the "password required"
  glyph (a circle with a diagonal line) in the
  host list.
 
  To add a password to an existing host entry,
  select the desired name from the host list,
  enter the password in the Root Password field,
  then select the Change Entry command from the
  Edit menu.  If you are creating a new host
  entry and know in advance you will need a
  password, you may enter the password in con-
  junction with the host's name, prior to
  executing the Add Entry function.
 
  To guard against eavesdropping, the password
  is not echoed as you enter characters.  Use
  the Clear button to determine whether the
  Root Password field contains a value; if the
  button is active the field contains a value.
  The existing value will be automatically
  re-used.  If you need to enter a different
  value, you may use the line kill character,
  the Delete key, or the Clear button to erase
  the previous value.

# 
:HostApply
Apply Button
 
Commits the host list and host selections to the program.
 
  When you are ready to commit the current host
  list and selections to the program, press the
  Apply button.  Subsequent installations and
  removals during this session will operate on
  the hosts selected in the list, in the order
  in which they appear in the list. Note that
  this does not save the list to a file; this
  must be done using the File menu items Save
  or Save As.

# 
:HostReset
Reset Button
 
Resets the host list and host selection to their program values.
 
  Use this button to reset the host list and
  selections to reflect their current program
  values.  These values are those in force when
  you last pressed Apply or those taken from the
  program's configuration file (if you have not
  yet applied any changes).  Note that the file-
  based configuration does not save selection
  status or root passwords.
