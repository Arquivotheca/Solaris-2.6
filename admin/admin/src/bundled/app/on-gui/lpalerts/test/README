Enclosed is a test program doText.c, a makefile and the binary. If you run
this program with an integer argument n, it will run n iterations of 
tests on the 3 scripts: jobdone, printer, and forms.  The default (with
no argument) is 100. The program randomly tries calling one of the three
scripts with random arguments.  It prints out a summary at the end.

I have had a problem when running this program. After about 50
iterations, ToolTalk gets out of sync and appears to produce failures.
I am hoping that the 494 version of ToolTalk doesn't behave this way.
I know that 1093 has a bug in it thay may cause it. If it misbehaves and
you are using 494 TookTalk,let me know.

The program misbehaves in the following way. It consists of a loop which
generates a random message, sends it by calling jobdone, print or form and
then receives the message. The following is the sequence of messages.

     send A     receive A
     send B     receive B
     send C     receive C
     send D     receive C (problem begins here)
     send E     receive D
     send F     receive D
     ...
