---- Description ----------------------------------------------------

     Specifies the name of this system; if the system is on a 
     network, it uniquely identifies it among all other systems.

     Host names are often assigned by network or system
     administrators according to site policies.  Because creating
     duplicate host names can cause network problems, do not guess;
     check with your system or network administrator.
