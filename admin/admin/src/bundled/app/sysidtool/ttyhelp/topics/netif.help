---- Description -----------------------------------------------------

     Specifies the primary network interface for your system.

     This information is requested if the software detects multiple
     Ethernet cards or network adapter cards on your system.  This 
     screen will be displayed if you're installing a gateway from a 
     CD-ROM.  

     In most cases, the correct choice is the lowest numbered
     interface (for example, if the choices are le0 and le1, the
     lowest is le0).  However, if you don't know, ask your system
     or network administrator. 

     CAUTION: If you specify the incorrect primary network interface, 
              your system may not be able to find a name service.
