client          
                A system that obtains all or part of its resources from
                another system (a server).

domain          
                A part of the Internet naming hierarchy.  It represents
                a group of systems on a network that share adminis-
		trative files.

domain name     
                The identification of a group of systems on a local
                network.  The domain name is required for a name service
                to work properly.  An Internet domain name consists of
                component names separated by periods (for example:
                tundra.mpk.cal.us).  As you read a domain name from left
                to right, the component names identify more general (and
                usually remote) areas of administrative authority.

/etc           
                A directory owned and maintained by a system 
                administrator.  Contains user id data files, accounting 
                programs, and installation information. 

gateway
                A system that acts as a bridge between two physical
                networks, forwarding traffic between them.
             

host name      
                The name by which a system is known to other systems
		on a network.  This name must be unique among all the
		systems within any given domain (usually, this means 
                within any single organization).  A host name can be 
                any combination of letters, numbers, and minus sign (-), 
                but it cannot begin or end with a minus sign.


Internet Protocol (IP)

		A set of conventions used by Solaris-based systems to
		communicate with other systems via networks.
	
IP address      
                A unique number that identifies a networked system so
                it can communicate via Internet Protocols.  It consists
                of four numbers separated by periods.  Most often, each
                part of the IP address is a number between 0 and 225;
                however, the first number must be less than 224, and 
                the last number generally cannot be 0.
                
                IP addresses are logically divided into two parts: 
                the network (similar to a telephone area code), and the 
                host (similar to a phone number).	
		
name service    
                A distributed network database that contains key system
                information about all the systems on a network, so the
                systems can communicate with each other.  With a name
                service, the system information can be maintained,
		managed, and accessed on a network-wide basis.  Sun
		supports the following naming services: NIS+ and NIS
		(formerly YP).  Without a naming service, each system
		has to maintain its own copy of the system information
		in the local /etc files.

name server     
                A server that provides a naming service to systems on
                a network.  When using NIS+, the name server can be a
                master or replica server; when using NIS, the name
                server can be a master or slave server.

netmask     
                A bit mask. which is 32 bits long, used to determine
                important network or system information from an IP
                address. 

networked systems

                A group of systems (called hosts) connected together 
                through hardware and software, so they can communicate 
                and share information; referred to as a local area
		network (LAN).  One or more servers are needed when
		systems area networked.  Networked systems can be set
		up as the following system types: standalone, server,
		diskless, or dataless.

non-networked systems

                Systems that are not connected to a network or do not
                rely on other systems.  Non-networked systems should be
                set up as system type standalone. 
 
NIS
		Network Information Service, Plus.  A type of name
		service that is standard on SunOS 3.x, 4.x, and Solaris
		1.x systems.

NIS+
		Network Information Service, Plus.  The replacement
		for NIS that provides automatic information updating
		and adds security features such as authorization and
		authentication.  NIS+ is the standard name service on
		Solaris 2.x systems.

server
                A system that provides services to systems on a	network
		To serve diskless clients, a server must have disk space
                set aside for each diskless client's root file system
                and swap space (/export/root, /export/swap).  To serve
                dataless clients, a server must provide the /usr and
                /usr/kvm file systems.

Solaris installation program

                A menu-driven, interactive program that enables you to
                set up a system to install Solaris.  If installing from
                a graphics monitor, a graphical user interface (GUI)
                is provided; if installing Solaris from a non-graphics 
                monitor, a character user interface (CUI) is provided.   

subnet          
                A working scheme that divides a single logical network
                into smaller physical networks to simplify routing.

system type    
                A term that defines how a system will be set up to
                run Solaris.  The valid system types are: standalone 
                system, dataless client, and diskless client.

time zone
                Any of the 24 longitudinal divisions of the earth's
		surface for which a standard time is kept.
