---- Netmask ---------------------------------------

     Specifies your system's netmask.

     The netmask is a series of four numbers
     separated by periods, specifying which portion
     of an IP address is the network part and which
     is the host part.  If you do not know your
     netmask, do not guess; check with your system
     or network administrator.
