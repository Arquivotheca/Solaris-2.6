---- Description -----------------------------------

     Specifies whether your system is currently
     connected to a network.  The system must
     physically be connected to the network by an
     Ethernet card or network adapter card.

     The Solaris installation program needs the
     connection so it can find as much information
     as possible from the network about your
     system.
