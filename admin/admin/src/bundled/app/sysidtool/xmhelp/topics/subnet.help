---- Description -----------------------------------

     Specifies whether your system is on a network
     that has subnets.

     If the network to which your system is
     connected is divided into subnets (usually
     using routers or gateways), answer Yes.  If
     you do not know if your network has subnets,
     do not guess; check with your system
     administrator for help.
