---- Description -----------------------------------

     Specifies the name of this system; if the
     system is on a network, it uniquely identifies
     it among all other systems.

     Host names are often assigned by network or
     system administrators according to site
     policies.  Because creating duplicate host
     names can cause network problems, do not
     guess; check with your system or network
     administrator.
