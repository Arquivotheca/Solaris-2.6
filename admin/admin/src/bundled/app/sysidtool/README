		of the machine as well as the locale.

sysidnis - Identifies the nameservice of the machine (as well as netmask
		if necessary)

sysidsys - Identifies the system information (timezone, date) as well
		as netmask, if necessary

sysidroot - Identifies the root password of the machine

sysidconfig - Identifies device configuration information on Intel
	(invokes kdmconfig)

Subdirectories are:

ttyhelp - Directories and files that implement the tty help screens

xmhelp - Directories and files that implement the X motif help screens

backend_simulator - Files and directories that contain the "backend"
	simulator for sysidtool, including test programs and test cases
	for the simulator code.
