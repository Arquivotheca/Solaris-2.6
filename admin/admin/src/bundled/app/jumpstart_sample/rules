#       @(#)rules 1.12 94/07/27 SMI
#
# The rules file is a text file used to create the rules.ok file for
# a custom JumpStart installation. The rules file is a lookup table
# consisting of one or more rules that define matches between system
# attributes and profiles.
# 
# This example rules file contains:
#   o syntax of a rule used in the rules file
#   o rule_keyword and rule_value descriptions
#   o rule examples
#
# See the installation manual for a complete description of the rules file.

# RULE SYNTAX:
#
# [!]rule_keyword rule_value [&& [!]rule_keyword rule_value]... begin profile finish
#
#    "[ ]"  indicates an optional expression or field
#    "..."  indicates the preceding expression may be repeated
#     "&&"  used to "logically AND" rule_keyword and rule_value pairs together
#      "!"  indicates negation of the following rule_keyword 
#
#  rule_keyword   a predefined keyword that describes a general system
#                 attribute. It is used with the rule_value to match a
#                 system with the same attribute to a profile.
#
#  rule_value     a value that provides the specific system attribute
#                 for the corresponding rule_keyword. A rule_value can
#                 be text or a range of values (NN-MM).
#                 To match a range of values, a system's value must be
#                 greater than or equal to NN and less than or equal to MM.
#
#  begin          a file name of an optional Bourne shell script
#                 that will be executed before the installation begins.
#                 If no begin script exists, you must enter a minus sign (-)
#                 in this field.
#
#  profile        a file name of a text file used as a template by the
#                 custom JumpStart installation software that defines how 
#                 to install Solaris on a system. 
#
#  finish         a file name of an optional Bourne shell script
#                 that will be executed after the installation completes.
#                 If no finish script exists, you must enter a minus sign (-)
#                 in this field.
#
# Notes:
# 1. You can add comments after the pound sign (#) anywhere on a line. 
# 2. Rules are matched in descending order: first rule through the last rule.
# 3. Rules can be continued to a new line by using the backslash (\) before
#    the carriage return. 
# 4. Don't use the "*" character or other shell wildcards, because the rules
#    file is interpreted by a Bourne shell script.
