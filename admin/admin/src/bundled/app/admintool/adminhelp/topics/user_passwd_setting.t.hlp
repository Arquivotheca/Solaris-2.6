---- Password Setting ------------------------------ 

Security is an issue when setting a user password. 
You don't want to choose a password that could be
easily guessed, possibly allowing unauthorized
access to a user's data. One method of setting a
user password that offers some security is to choose
two random words and combine them with a digit or
punctuation mark.
