---- UNIX Groups -----------------------------------

Using UNIX(R) groups enables a system administrator
to define a set of users that need to access the
same file resources. Users in the same group can
access each others' files based on the group
permission set.

Using Admintool to set up a UNIX group is convenient
when a group of users are working on the same
project and need access to the same files.
