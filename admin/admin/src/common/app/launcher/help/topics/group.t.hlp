---- Group Manager ------------------------------------------
 
Group Manager enables system administrators to manage group
information without having to modify the group file with an
editor.

Use Group Manager to perform the following tasks:

-	Add and remove UNIX groups
-	Add and remove user names from UNIX groups

Group Manager can be used to manage the group file on the local
system or the NIS or NIS+ database with the appropriate access
privileges.
