# The following symbols are all UNCOMMITTED and documented in section 3K.
#
# The UNCOMMITTED classification is due to the fact that there is almost
# nothing you can put as a symbol in a namelist which has any form of
# release to release stability.  The syntax of these routines is actually
# pretty stable, but being UNCOMMITTED, the door is always open for change.
