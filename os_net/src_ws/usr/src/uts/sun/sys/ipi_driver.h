 *
 * q_addr	this is a readonly value (set by *id_setup (below))
 *
 * q_cmd	this points to an ipi3 command packet that the driver
 *		fills in prior to issuing the command (see id_start below).
 *		The channel subsystem will fill in the command reference
 *		number when the command is sent to the slave or facility.
 *		NOTE: for asynchronous responses, this field will be NULL!
 *
 * q_resp:	pointer to an ipi3 response packet, valid after a completion
 *		routine is called, but not valid after a return from the
 *		completion call. NOTE: this field will be NULL if there
 *		is no response.
 *
 * q_private:	private storage for the slave or facility driver.
 *
 * q_tnp:	pointer to transfer notification parameter that the
 *		slave or facility driver must insert into its command
 *		(length of this paramater is in q_tnp_len (below)).
 *
 * q_time:	time, in seconds, a driver allows for this command to
 *		complete. Set to zero to disable timeout for command.
 *
 * q_flag:	command flags
 *
 * q_tnp_len:	length of transfer notification parameter (read only to
 *		slave or facility driver).
 *
 * q_retry:	number of times a retry on a command attempted. It is up
 *		to the slave/facility driver to decide when enough retries
 *		have been done. This field is zeroed on ipiq_t allocation.
 *
 * q_result:	result/state code, valid only upon command completion.

 * On completion of IPI channel commands,

 *
 * It should be declared like this:
 *
 *	void
 *	ipi_handler(ipiq_t *q)
 *
 * The IPI channel subsystem is informed of the existence of this
 * interrupt handler function by the use of the id_ctrl IPI vector
 * function (see below) with the IPI_CTRL_REGISTER_IFUNC argument.
 *
 * The result of the operation is summarized in q->q_result
 * by one of the values described below.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * 1. IP_MISSING
 *
 *	The abort action recommended here is an actual IPI ABORT command
 *	if the slave supports it. Otherwise, just retry the command.
 *
 * 2. IP_ABORTED
 *
 *	The fact that this value is in the result code only reflects
 *	that channel has returned this command at the request of the
 *	slave or facility driver. The command may actually still be
 *	in progress on the slave or facility. An actul IPI ABORT
 *	command may be warranted to try and ensure that the command
 *	is actually not still running on the slave or facility.
 *
 * 3. IP_ERROR vs. IP_COMPLETE
 *
 *	The only time IP_ERROR should be set is when the transport
 *	layer detects some kind of local (i.e., non-IPI) fault condition.
