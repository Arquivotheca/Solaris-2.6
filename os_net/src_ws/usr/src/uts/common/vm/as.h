/*
 * VM - Address spaces.
 */

/*
 * Each address space consists of a sorted list of segments
 * and machine dependent address translation information.
 *
 * All the hard work is in the segment drivers and the
 * hardware address translation code.
 *
 * The segment list can be represented as a simple linked list or as a
 * skiplist.  The skiplist facilitates faster searches when there are
 * many segments.  A linked list is used until a_nsegs grows beyond
 * AS_MUTATION_THRESH.  At that point, the linked list mutates into a
 * skiplist.  a_lrep indicates the list's current representation.
 *
 * The address space lock (a_lock) is a long term lock which serializes
 * access to certain operations (as_map, as_unmap) and protects the
 * underlying generic segment data (seg.h) along with some fields in the
 * address space structure as shown below:
 *
 *	address space structure 	segment structure
 *
 *	a_segs				s_base
 *	a_size				s_size
 *	a_nsegs				s_as
 *	a_hilevel			s_next
 *	a_cache				s_prev
 *	a_lrep				s_ops
 *	a_tail				s_data
 *
 * The address space contents lock (a_contents) is a short term
 * lock that protects most of the data in the address space structure.
 * This lock is always acquired after the "a_lock" in all situations
 * except while dealing with a_claimgap to avoid deadlocks.
 *
 * The following fields are protected by this lock:
 *
 *	a_paglck
 *	a_claimgap
 *	a_unmapwait
 *	a_cache
 *
 * Note that a_cache can be updated while a_lock is held for read, but
 * when the segment list representation is a skiplist (a_lrep ==
 * AS_LREP_SKIPLIST), updates to (*a_cache.spath) are protected by the
 * mutex lock a_contents.  This ensures the atomicity of the update,
 * and guarantees internal consistency of spath's contents.  During a
 * skiplist insertion or deletion, however, a_cache is also protected
 * by a_lock being held for write.
 *
 * The address space lock (a_lock) is always held prior to any segment
 * operation.  Some segment drivers use the address space lock to protect
 * some or all of their segment private data, provided the version of
 * "a_lock" (read vs. write) is consistent with the use of the data.
 *
 * The following fields are protected by the hat layer lock:
 *
 *	a_vbits
 *	a_hat
 *	a_hrm
