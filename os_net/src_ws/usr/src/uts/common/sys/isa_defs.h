/*
 * This header file serves to group a set of well known defines and to
 * set these for each instruction set architecture.  These defines may
 * be divided into two groups;  characteristics of the processor and
 * implementation choices for Solaris on a processor.
 *
 * Processor Characteristics:
 *
 * _LITTLE_ENDIAN / _BIG_ENDIAN:
 *	The natural byte order of the processor.  A pointer to an int points
 *	to the least/most significant byte of that int.
 *
 * _STACK_GROWS_UPWARD / _STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD:
 *	The processor specific direction of stack growth.  A push onto the
 *	stack increases/decreases the stack pointer, so it stores data at
 *	successively higher/lower addresses.  (Stackless machines ignored
 *	without regrets).
 *
 * _LONG_LONG_HTOL / _LONG_LONG_LTOH:
 *	A pointer to a long long points to the most/least significant long
 *	within that long long.
 *
 * _BIT_FIELDS_HTOL / _BIT_FIELDS_LTOH:
 *	The C compiler assigns bit fields from the high/low to the low/high end
 *	of an int (most to least significant vs. least to most significant).
 *
 * _IEEE_754:
 *	The processor (or supported implementations of the processor)
 *	supports the ieee-754 floating point standard.  No other floating
 *	point standards are supported (or significant).  Any other supported
 *	floating point formats are expected to be cased on the ISA processor
 *	symbol.
 *
 * _CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED / _CHAR_IS_SIGNED:
 *	The C Compiler implements objects of type `char' as `unsigned' or
 *	`signed' respectively.  This is really an implementation choice of
 *	the compiler writer, but it is specified in the ABI and tends to
 *	be uniform across compilers for an instruction set architecture.
 *	Hence, it has the properties of a processor characteristic.
 *
 * _CHAR_ALIGNMENT / _SHORT_ALIGNMENT / _INT_ALIGNMENT / _LONG_ALIGNMENT /
 * _LONG_LONG_ALIGNMENT / _DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT / _LONG_DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT /
 * _POINTER_ALIGNMENT:
 *	The ABI defines alignment requirements of each of the primitive
 *	object types.  Some, if not all, may be hardware requirements as
 * 	well.  The values are expressed in "byte-alignment" units.
 *
 * _MAX_ALIGNMENT:
 *	The most stringent alignment requirement as specified by the ABI.
 *	Equal to the maximum of all the above _XXX_ALIGNMENT values.
 *
 * _ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED:
 *	True or false (1 or 0) whether or not the hardware requires the ABI
 *	alignment.
 *
 *
 * Implementation Choices:
 *
 * _ILP32 / _LP64:
 *	This specifies the compiler data type implementation as specified in
 *	the relevant ABI.  The choice between these is strongly influenced
 *	by the underlying hardware, but is not absolutely tied to it.
 *	Currently only two data type models are supported:
 *
 *	_ILP32:
 *		Int/Long/Pointer are 32 bits.  This is the historical UNIX
 *		and Solaris implementation.  Due to its historical standing,
 *		this is the default case.
 *
 *	_LP64:
 *		Long/Pointer are 64 bits, Int is 32 bits.  This is the chosen
 *		implementation for 64-bit ABIs such as SPARC V9.
 *
 *	In all cases, Char is 8 bits and Short is 16 bits.
 *
 * _SUNOS_VTOC_8 / _SUNOS_VTOC_16 / _SVR4_VTOC_16:
 *	This specifies the form of the disk VTOC (or label):
 *
 *	_SUNOS_VTOC_8:
 *		This is a VTOC form which is upwardly compatible with the
 *		SunOS 4.x disk label and allows 8 partitions per disk.
 *
 *	_SUNOS_VTOC_16:
 *		In this format the incore vtoc image matches the ondisk
 *		version.  It allows 16 slices per disk, and is not
 *		compatible with the SunOS 4.x disk label.
 *
 *	Note that these are not the only two VTOC forms possible and
 *	additional forms may be added.  One possible form would be the
 *	SVr4 VTOC form.  The symbol for that is reserved now, although
 *	it is not implemented.
 *
 *	_SVR4_VTOC_16:
 *		This VTOC form is compatible with the System V Release 4
 *		VTOC (as implemented on the SVr4 Intel and 3b ports) with
 *		16 partitions per disk.
 *
 *
 * _DMA_USES_PHYSADDR / _DMA_USES_VIRTADDR
 *	This describes the type of addresses used by system DMA:
 *
 *	_DMA_USES_PHYSADDR:
 *		This type of DMA, used in the x86 and PowerPC implementations,
 *		requires physical addresses for DMA buffers.  The 24-bit
 *		addresses used by some legacy boards is the source of the
 *		"low-memory" (<16MB) requirement for some devices using DMA.
 *
 *	_DMA_USES_VIRTADDR:
 *		This method of DMA allows the use of virtual addresses for
 *		DMA transfers.
 *
 * _FIRMWARE_NEEDS_FDISK / _NO_FDISK_PRESENT
 *      This indicates the presence/absence of an fdisk table.
 *
 *      _FIRMWARE_NEEDS_FDISK
 *              The fdisk table is required by system firmware.  If present,
 *              it allows a disk to be subdivided into multiple fdisk
 *              partitions, each of which is equivalent to a separate,
 *              virtual disk.  This enables the co-existence of multiple
 *              operating systems on a shared hard disk.
 *
 *      _NO_FDISK_PRESENT
 *              If the fdisk table is absent, it is assumed that the entire
 *              media is allocated for a single operating system.
