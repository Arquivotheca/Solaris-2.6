/*
 * SCSI autoconfiguration definitions.
 *
 * The library routine scsi_slave() is provided as a service to target
 * driver to check for existence  and readiness of a SCSI device. It is
 * defined as:
 *
 *	int scsi_slave(struct scsi_device *devp, int (*callback()))
 *
 * where devp is the scsi_device structure passed to the target driver
 * at probe time, and where callback declares whether scsi_slave() can
 * sleep awaiting resources or must return an error if it cannot get
 * resources (callback == SLEEP_FUNC implies that scsi_slave()
 * can sleep - although this
 * does not fully guarantee that resources will become available as
 * some are allocated from the iopbmap which may just be completely
 * full).  The user call also supplies a callback function or NULL_FUNC.
 * In the process of determining the existence of a SCSI device,
 * scsi_slave will allocate space for the sd_inq field of the scsi_device
 * pointed to by devp (if it is non-zero upon entry).
 *
 * scsi_slave() attempts to follow this sequence in order to determine
 * the existence of a SCSI device:
 *
 *	Attempt to send 2 TEST UNIT READY commands to the device.
 *
 *		If that gets a check condition, run a non-extended
 *		REQUEST SENSE command. Ignore the results of it, as
 *		a the non-extended sense information contains only
 *		Vendor Unique error codes (the idea is that during
 *		probe time the nearly invariant first command to a
 *		device will get a Check Condition, and the real reason
 *		is that the device wants to tell you that a SCSI bus
 *		reset just occurred.
 *
 *	Attempt to allocate an inquiry buffer and
 *	run an INQUIRY command (with response data format 0 set).
 *
 *		If that gets a check condition, run another
 *		non-extended REQUEST SENSE command.
 *
 * The library routine scsi_probe() is provided as a service to target
 * driver to check for bare-bones existence of a SCSI device. It is
 * defined as:
 *
 *	int scsi_probe(struct scsi_device *devp, int (*callback()))
 *
 * scsi_probe() only executes an inquiry.
 *
 * Both functions return one of the integer values as defined below:
