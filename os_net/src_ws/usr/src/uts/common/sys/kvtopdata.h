/*
 * crash dump, libkvm support
 *
 * The kernel is not guaranteed to be loaded at a particular fixed
 * physical address.  To support virtual to physical address
 * translations a table of the relevant kernel mappings is built
 * by the routine setup_kvpm.  This table can be read from /dev/mem by
 * getting its physical address from the msgbuf header which is
 * guaranteed to be at a fixed physical address.  Although the
 * the kernel is not loaded at a fixed address, most of its
 * segments get allocated in chunks of contiguous physical memory.  The
 * ones that aren't are dynamic and have their own data structures,
 * - usually ptes - to describe the mapping.  These extra data structures
 * are in the kernel's data segment which is covered by one of the
 * ranges covered in the map below.
 *
 * NKVTOPENTS can change from one version of kvtopdata to another.  Applications
 * should use nentries to figure how many entries are in kvtopmap.
