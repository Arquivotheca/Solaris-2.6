/*
 * Resource Allocation Maps.
 *
 * Associated routines manage sub-allocation of an address space using
 * an array of segment descriptors.  The first element of this array
 * is a map structure, describing the number of free elements in the array
 * and a count of the number of processes sleeping on an allocation failure.
 * Each additional structure represents a free segment of the address space.
 * The final entry has a zero in the segment size and a pointer to the name
 * of the controlled object in the address field.
 *
 * A call to rmallocmap dynamically allocates and initializes a
 * resource map. rmfree is then used to associate the map with the
 * actual resource.
 *
 * Subsequent calls to rmalloc and rmfree allocate and free space in the
 * resource map.  rmalloc() returns zero if insufficient space is available.
 * To wait for space, use rmalloc_wait().  If the resource
 * map becomes too fragmented to be described in the available space,
 * then some of the resource is discarded.  This may lead to critical
 * shortages, but is better than not checking (as the previous versions
 * of these routines did) or giving up and calling panic().  The routines
 * could use linked lists and call a memory allocator when they run
 * out of space, but that would not solve the out of space problem when
 * called at interrupt time.
 *
 * N.B.: The address 0 in the resource address space is not available
 * as it is used internally by the resource map routines.
