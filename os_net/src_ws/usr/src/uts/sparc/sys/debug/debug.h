/*
 * This file describes the interface between the kernel their debuggers.
 * Actually, the term ``kernel'' here is too restrictive - it actually
 * applies to any standalone program which is to be run under a debugger.
 * The term ``debugger'' here applies to any debugger service which
 * uses this interface.
 *
 * The debugger requires that nobody mess with parts of virtual
 * memory if they expect any debugger services.  These rules
 * apply to all the virtual memory between DEBUGSTART and DEBUGEND:
 *
 *   *	Do not write to these addresses.
 *   *	Do not read from (depend on the contents of) these addresses,
 *	except as documented in the debugvec structure.
 *   *	Do not remap these addresses.
 *   *	Do not change or double-map the pmegs that these addresses
 *	map through.
 *   *	Do not change or double-map the main memory that these
 *	addresses map to.
 *   *	These rules apply in
 *		all map contexts (Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i)
 *		the kernel context 0 (Sun-2)
 *
 * Besides the rules for virtual memory cooperation, the following
 * debugger/debuggee interface is defined:
 *
 *   *	If a debugger is present, it will pass in a '-d' flag
 *	to the program being debugged (although the program being
 *	debugged might want to verify that the debugger is actually
 *	present before taking it as the truth to avoid problems
 *	with users using the wrong flags in the wrong places).
 *	The '-d' flag being passed into the debugger itself will
 *	cause the debugger to prompt for debuggee program name and
 *	allow debugger commands before debuggee is started.
 *   *	The top *dvec->dv_pages tell the number of pages
 *	taken from the end of memory.  If the debuggee is
 *	managing all memory, the amount of usable memory is:
 *	  *romp->v_memorysize  - mmu_ptob(*dvec->dv_pages) [earlier PROMs]
 *	  *romp->v_memoryavail - mmu_ptob(*dvec->dv_pages) [later PROMs]
 *   *	If the debuggee changes the trace exception handler or
 *	the trap exception handler for TRAPBRKNO, it MUST call
 *	(*dvec->dv_scbsync)() after all exception handler changes
 *	are made.  Other exception handlers can be changed
 *	without any special provisions.
 *   *	If the debuggee is going to relocate itself, it is very
 *	desirable to have it call (*dvec->dv_scbsync)() soon
 *	AFTER the relocation to the correct virtual address.
 *   *	The debuggee can call the debugger at any time by
 *	an explicit call using the CALL_DEBUG() macro,
 *	a ``trap #TRAPBRKNO'' (68000), ``t TRAPBRKNO'' (sparc),
 *	``int 3'' (i386), or by jumping to *dvec->dv_trap.
 *   *	The debuggee is expected not to try and trace itself
 *	under the debugger - the only way the trace bit can
 *	be turned on in the debuggee is via the ``rte''
 *	instruction.  This case is detected and handled
 *	correctly by the debugger when single stepping,
 *	except in the case were the rte is returning to
 *	another rte which is returning to user land
 *	(welcome to the real world of 680x0 processors).

/*
 * XXX	Stop press:
 *
 * Note that the remarks in this file that deal with the
 * virtual address range occupied by the debugger are somewhat out
 * of date - in 5.0, the exact place the debugger sits
 * in memory is implicitly described by the 'virt-avail' list
 * exported by boot.
 *
 * If you *really* need to know what used to be called 'DEBUGSTART'
 * then issue a BOP_GETPROP() on the 'debugger-start' property which
 * is a property provided by the debugger itself.
 *
 * XXX	We should probably do the same thing for the 'DEBUGSIZE' value too.

/*
 * The debugger gets a one megabyte virtual address range in which it
 * can reside.  It is hoped that this space is large enough to accommodate
 * the largest kernel debugger that would be needed but not too large to
 * cramp the kernel's virtual address space.  We locate the debugger
 * in the megabyte before the PROM monitor, except on the 386, where we
 * locate it 16 megabytes (minus 20k) in front of the monitor.
