/*
 * Various neat things can be done with high speed clock sampling.
 *
 * This code along with fast_profile_intr() in locore.s and the
 * ddi_add_fastintr() call in profile_attach() is here as an example of
 * how to go about doing them.
 *
 * Because normal kernel profiling has a fairly low sampling rate we do
 * not currently use this code.  Instead we use a regular interrupt
 * handler, which is much slower, but has the benefit of not having to
 * be written in a single window of assembly code.
 *
 * This code has not been updated to work with the new profiling buffer
 * data structures.  And thus it is intenteded to be used for illustration
 * purposes only.
