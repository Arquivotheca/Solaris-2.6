# Since assym.s is a derived file, the dependency must be explicit for
# all files including this file. (This is only actually required in the
# instance when the .nse_depinfo file does not exist.) It may seem that
# the lint targets should also have a similar dependency, but they don't
# since only C headers are included when #defined(lint) is true.
