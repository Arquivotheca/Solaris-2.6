			The L file

Here's a sample L file (indent on this page):

		----LFILE----
		libname
		N-00000
		N-00001
		N-00002

The first line contains a security string which both dump and the
executor need to recheck when they open the file.

The second line contains the tape library name.  All tape names are of
the form libname:00003.

Subsequent lines look like this:

		N-00000
		|||
		||tape id number [maybe you want to know the db?]
		|used flag: - = untouched, + = touched this tape
		status flag:    N-new P-Partial E-Error F-Full U-new/unlabelled

The status flag is for dump's benefit (to know which tapes on which to
write) and the executor to know which tapes are error'd out.

Dump needs to read in the file and update both the statuses and the used
flags.  Leave the first two lines intact and change subsequent lines.

Add a new line at the end for each new tape you use (because you ran out and had
to request one from the operator).

Note well that you need to update the `used flag' whenever you write
to a tape and that you need to set and interpret the flags that
change from {NP} -> P -> F (or -> E).

Never write on an E tape.

Never write on a P tape.

You need update the file only on exit.

One line is special (when returned from dump)
		N+00001 5

and tells the executor the tape position of the NEXT dump to be done
on the tape (which is the first remaining writeable tape).  The first
file on a tape is file 1.
