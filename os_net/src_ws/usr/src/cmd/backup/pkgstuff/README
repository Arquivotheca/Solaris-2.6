Answer to question #1:  How to get a new patch ID.

   getpatch@raid.Corp

Answer to question #2:  Who to send patches to.

   The SunSoft Patch Manager is Alex.Simonovich@Corp.  You can
   coordinate with him to deliver the patch.  A deliver utility
   does exist.  Actually, it looks like two delivery utilities
   exist.  I'm not sure which one you should use or what the 
   differences are.  We use submitpatch, I believe.  See:

   benet:/benet/Sustaining/PatchTools/{submitpatch, sunsoftsubmitpatch}

Answer to unasked question #3 about how to generate README.patchid files:

   See benet:/benet/Sustaining/PatchTools/{genreadme, genreadme_style_guide}

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

brian, i'll show you how i make patches for online: backup.  this
should be pretty similar to what you'll need to do.

once we've done that, here's what i would do.

    email getpatch@raid.corp.  this will get you your own unique
    	patchid.

    make a directory whose name is the patchid, including a minor
    	number, e.g. 101176 is your patch id, mkdir 101176-01.

    copy /net/benet.eng/benet/Sustaining/PatchTools/{installpatch,backoutpatch}
    	to your new directory.

    get the goods to make your package.  this will include the
    	patched binaries, etc.  it should be a subset of your already
    	existing package.

    strip out the prototype file for your package, so that it includes
    	only the stuff you're patching.

    do a `pkgmk'.  ask julian taylor (the package god) if you run into
    	any problems.

    do a `cp -r /var/spool/pkg/SUNWnwcl 101176-01' (or whatever).

    do a /net/benet.eng/benet/Sustaining/PatchTools/genreadme to make
        a readme file to go into 101176-01.

    talk to alex simonovich about handing it off!  he should know
    	about test issues, etc.
