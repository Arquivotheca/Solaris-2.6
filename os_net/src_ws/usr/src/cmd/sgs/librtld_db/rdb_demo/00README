This directory contains source code to the rdb debugger.  This debugger
is distributed as an example client of the librtld_db.so.1 interface.
As well as offering examples of the proper calling sequence for the
librtld_db.so.1 interface rdb also offers a sample implementation of the
proc_services (/usr/include/proc_service.h) that rdb is dependent upon.

The following is an overview of the directory structure and highlight
of some of the important files contained within:

rdb.man		- man page for the rdb debugger
Makefile.com
Makefile.targ	- common Makefiles included by ${MACH)/Makefile
common/*	- common source code used for all architectures
sparc/
i386/
ppc/		- contains architecture specific source files and also
		  acts as the build directory
sparc/Makefile
i386/Makefile
ppc/Makefile	- makefiles to build rdb for each architecture
test/*		- sample command files which can be used to test rdb

Building rdb
------------
Before attempting to build the rdb debugger be sure that you have
installed the Solaris Developer Cluster and a C compiler (purchased
serpartly) onto your system.

To build rdb:

% cd {sparc,i386,ppc}	- depending on which architecture you are building for
% make all

To test the demo:

% make test
