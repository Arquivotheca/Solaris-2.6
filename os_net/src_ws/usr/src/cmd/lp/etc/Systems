#
#		Comment
#	NOTE:
#	Unused fields must contain a dash except for the password field
#	which should contain an ``x'' and the comment field which can
#	be blank.
#
#	Example:
#	
#	Kepler:x:-:bsd:-:n:10:-:-:
#	fubar:x:-:bsd:10:n:-:-:
#	Galileo:x:-:bsd:-:30:10:-:-:
#
#
#	If the first field (I.e. the System Name) contains a "+", then
#	*all* incoming connections will be established, regardless of
#	whether or not there's an entry here for the remote system!
#	This will reduce your maintenance when you have a number of
#	clients, and you don't really care about restricting
#	your printer. Conceivably a print server could just contain 
#	a single entry of the following form for clients:
#
#
#	+:x:-:bsd:-:n:10:-:-:Allow all connections

+:x:-:bsd:-:n:10:-:-:Allow all connections
