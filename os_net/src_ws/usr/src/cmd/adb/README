adb - 5.0 port version

ident	%z%README	1.1	89/08/07 SMI

As of 8/7/89, adb has been modified to run under the development state
of SunOS 5.0 - the SVr4 version. This means it:
	1) compiles and links in the 5.0 environment
	2) understands a.out file formats
The final goal will have to understand ELF (and possibly a.out) format(s).
Due to instability at this time:
	1) the -k option of adb has been disabled. This option depends
	   upon libkvm which is not part of 5.0 at this time.
	2) Three SunOS 4.1 header files (link.h, stab.h, and vfork.h)
	   have been installed locally in the sparc subdirectory. This
	   should be veiwed as a temporary measure.
	3) Only sparc adb for a.out format is supported: no ELF, no 68k,
	   NO kadb!

This is a quick job to get a working debugger for the 5.0 development
effort. Note however, that all the appropriate SCCS conventions have
been maintained.
