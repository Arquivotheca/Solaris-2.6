To build the PS consolidation workspace, execute the following steps:

1) Copy the sample wsenv script and tailor it to the environment.  If
   the SunPro compiler that you plan to use is installed in the standard
   place (/opt/SUNWspro), the only environment variable that might need to 
   be changed is the REALMODE_ROOT variable and this variable only needs to 
   be set if building the PS consolidation on an x86 platform.  So, if 
   you're building the consolidation on an x86 machine and the PS 
   consolidation realmode source tree is located in ../realmode-crank, 
   simply uncomment REALMODE_ROOT, otherwise uncomment it and assign it the 
   path name of the directory beneath which you have installed the realmode 
   source tree.  

	cp wsenv.template wsenv
	vi wsenv

2) Dot the wsenv script to set the environment variables.

	. ./wsenv

3) Change directories to usr/src and build the system.

	cd <source_tree_root>/usr/src
	make -e clobber install > ../../build.log.<arch> 2>&1 &
	cd <source_tree_root>

	where <arch> is x86, sparc, or ppc, as appropriate.

4) Compare the build log generated with the sample provided.

	diff build.log.<arch> <source_tree_root>/build.log.<arch>.sample

	where <arch> is x86, sparc, or ppc, as appropriate.
