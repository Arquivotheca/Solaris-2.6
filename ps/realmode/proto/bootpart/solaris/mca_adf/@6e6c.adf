"The base address of the ACPA/A can be at one of 4 different
locations. Choose a location which does not conflict with any
other installed board.  'Disable' will cause the ACPA/A to 
not be available.  This assignment need only be changed if it
is in conflict with another board.  Conflicting assignments
are marked with an asterisk.  Use the F5=Previous and the 
F6=Next keys to change address selection when you are in the
'Change configuration' window."

"The interupt select chooses which interrupt level the ACPA/A
will use for interrupts.  Minimize the amount of interrupt
sharing by assigning other installed boards to different levels.
Conflicting assignments are marked with an asterisk.  Use the
F5=Previous and the F6=Next keys to change the interrupt level
selection if you are in the 'Change configuration' window."
