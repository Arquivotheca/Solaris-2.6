  "This option allows you to select the interrupt level that the
   adapter will use to interrupt the system unit.  The preferred
   interrupt level is 3, but the adapter can operate on any of the

   level can be changed by selecting 'CHANGE CONFIGURATION' and
   then using the F5=Previous and the F6=Next keys.
   If an assignment has an asterisk (*) by it, it is in
   conflict with another assignment and must be changed.
   NOTE...If multiple Auto LANStreamer adapters are present in
   the system, they must all be set to the same interrupt level."
