	 Some graphics cards support multiple resolutions. If you
     see this screen, your adapter is one of them. Select the
     highest resolution your monitor will accommodate. Selecting
     a resolution too high for your monitor may, in some cases,
     damage the monitor. Be sure your monitor supports the resolution
     you select.
