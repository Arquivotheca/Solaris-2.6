---- Description -----------------------------------------------------

     Specifies the interrupt number of the device.
	
     While Solaris can share IRQs among multiple devices, you 
     should assign a unique IRQ to each device for performance
     reasons.

     NOTE: Before attempting to use a single IRQ for two or more 
     devices, check the manufacturer's documentation for the 
     device; some hardware cards are not able to share IRQs with 
     other cards.
