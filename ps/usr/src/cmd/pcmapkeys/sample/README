The software described in this subdirectory has been contributed by
users. Sun Microsystems, Inc. does not warrant either the correctness
or the useability of this software.

The source files in this section are delivered for information purposes
only. They are in the POSIX.2 'localedef' format, using character
symbolic names. With the exception of the collation definition, which
can be used in 'colldef', the other category sources must be translated
from the symbolic format to absolute encoding.

New source files can be created using the compose file and the
appropriate dead/* file(s). The user must manually create the correct
scancode section, if none of the current scancode sections are
applicable.  The same is true for the input and output sections (see
pcmapkeys(1)).
