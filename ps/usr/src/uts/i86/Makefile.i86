#	This makefile contains the common definitions for all i86
#	implementation architecture independent modules.
#

#
#	Everybody needs to know how to build modstubs.o and to locate unix.o.
#	Note that unix.o must currently be selected from among the possible
#	"implementation architectures". Note further, that unix.o is only
#	used as an optional error check for undefines so (theoretically)
#	any "implementation architectures" could be used. We choose i86pc
#	because it is the reference port.

#
#	Define the base directory for installation.
#
BASE_INS_DIR	 = $(ROOT)

#
#	Include the makefiles which define build rule templates, the
#	collection of files per module, and a few specific flags. Note
#	that order is significant, just as with an include path. The
#	first build rule template which matches the files name will be
#	used. By including these in order from most machine dependent
#	to most machine independent, we allow a machine dependent file
#	to be used in preference over a machine independent version
#	(Such as a machine specific optimization, which preserves the
#	interfaces.)
