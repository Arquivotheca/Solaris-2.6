#ident	"@(#)sbpro.conf	1.11	96/06/07 SMI"

# SoundBlaster Configuration file (sbpro.conf).
#
# The sbpro driver supports these cards:
#     Sound Blaster PRO
#     Sound Blaster 16, with or without jumpers
#     Sound Blaster AWE32
#
# In the discussion below, the AWE32 should be treated the same as
# the SoundBlaster 16.
#
# This driver may also support certain "Sound Blaster compatible" devices,
# certain devices based on the Analog Devices AD184x chip, the Crystal
# Semiconductors CS4231 chip, and/or certain "Microsoft Windows Sound System
# (MWSS) compatible" devices.  For a current list of cards and motherboards
# known to work with this driver, consult the latest version of the "x86
# Device Configuration Guide," and/or the "x86 Driver Update Guide."

# Notes on "reg" property:
#     The first triple in the reg property must be unique for each entry
#     in this file.  By convention we use bus type -1 and the entry
#     number.  I/O addresses are specified in the reg property as bus
#     type 1, here in the second triple of the reg property.

# Notes on "interrupts" property:
#     In Solaris 2.4, there should be exactly two integers specified in
#     the interrupts property.  The first is the priority, normally 5.
#     The second is the IRQ of the SoundBlaster.  Supported IRQ channels
#     are 2, 5, 7, and 10.  Do not use the obsolete "intr" property.
#
#     See also the comments near the end of this file for MWSS IRQ settings.

# This is an old-style, non-conformant, driver.conf file.
# This file is not meant to be modified in the field.

##########  Entries for SoundBlaster PRO cards  ##########
#
# Notes on "dma-channels" property for SBPRO cards:
#     The SoundBlaster PRO uses one DMA channel; entries in this file for
#     the PRO should specify one DMA channel, which may be 0, 1, or 3.
#     The SoundBlaster PRO entries below assume the standard DMA channel
#     1.  If the DMA channel on your SBPRO card is not 1, you must edit
#     the appropriate setting here.  Edit the line containing the I/O
#     address and IRQ of your card so that it reflects the DMA setting
#     specified by the jumpers on your card.

##########  Entries for SoundBlaster 16 and AWE32 cards  ##########
#
# Notes on "dma-channels" property for SB16 cards:
#     The SoundBlaster 16 supports use of two DMA channels; if your card
#     has audio DMA jumpers, the driver will use the DMA channels
#     specified by those jumper settings, and you need not specify the
#     DMA address in the SB16 entries below.  (If you do specify the
#     dma-channels below, then they MUST MATCH the settings on your
#     jumpered card.)
#
#     If you have an SB16 card without audio IRQ and DMA jumpers
#     (including the AWE32), then you MUST specify the dma-channels
#     property below for the driver to support your card.  The driver
#     will not attach a non-jumpered card unless the dma-channels
#     property is specified.  In the case of a non-jumpered card, the
#     sbpro driver programs the card to use the IRQ and DMA channels
#     specified in the matching entry below.  ONLY ONE entry at a
#     particular I/O address should specify the dma-channels property --
#     that is how the driver knows which IRQ to use when programming the
#     card.
#
#     dma-channel entries below must specify two DMA channels.  The first
#     must be an 8 bit DMA channel, which may be 0, 1, or 3.  The second
#     should be a 16 bit DMA channel, which may be 5, 6, or 7.
#
#     Example:
#

#       interrupts=5,2 reg=-1,9,0,1,0x220,0x14 type="SB16" dma-channels=1,5;

##########  Entries for AD184x and compatible devices  ##########
#
# FOR A LIST OF SUPPORTED CARDS known to work with this driver,
# consult the latest version of the "x86 Device Configuration Guide,"
# and/or the "x86 Driver Update Guide."  The Guide will contain more
# specific information about the settings for each type of card or
# motherboard.
#
# Any CS4231-based devices supported by this driver are programmed in
# AD1848 compatibility mode.  There is no special support for the more
# advanced CS4231 features in this driver.
#
# The appropriate entry below must be modified to match your device's
# configuration, and uncommented.  Edit the line containing the I/O
# address of your card so that it reflects the IRQ and DMA setting you
# want to use.
#
# If your device has a "Microsoft Windows Sound System" compatibility
# register, the IRQ and DMA will be programmed from the entries below.
# The "type" property must be specified as "MWSS_AD184x".
#
# If your device has jumpers to select IRQ and/or DMA, or you have set
# them using a setup utility, your entry below must match that setting.
# The "type" property must be specified as "AD184x".
#
# Notes on "interrupts" property:
#     MWSS-compatibility allows the use of IRQ 7, 9, 10, or 11.
#
#     It is ESSENTIAL that you ensure that the IRQ you select does not
#     conflict with the IRQ of any other device in the system.  An IRQ
#     conflict may cause your system to hang when the driver attaches.
#     If this happens, reboot your system without the "-r" option and
#     change the IRQ to a non-conflicting value.
#
# Notes on "dma-channels" property:
#     The sbpro support for the AD184x uses one DMA channel for both
#     play and record; simultaneous play/record is not supported in
#     this driver.  Entries should specify one DMA channel, which may
#     be 0, 1, or 3.
