Dear Bruce Adler,

I have received your mail.
Here are some additional information and explanations.


BIOS-Update
-----------
We have verified the reported problem that the PC hangs when trying to 
save the old image of the BIOS.
Our tests had the following results:
- We were able to duplicate the problem when the BIOS image should be
  stored on a harddisk (C:) and using the old BIOS.
- The problem is fixed in newer versions of the BIOS.
- The problem can be solved when the old BIOS image is stored on a 
  diskette from which the MS-DOS is booted from.

This is a step by step instruction how to save and update the BIOS:
1. Format a MS-DOS system floppy disk and copy the file FLASHBIO.EXE to this
   disk.
   This is necessary because normally there is not enough storage capacity
   available to store the old BIOS image on the Flash Update Diskette.
2. Boot the PCE-5S and enter the System BIOS Setup 
   (pressing the keys Control-ALT-Insert during startup)
3. Disable Shadow-RAM (this is the second page of the setup)
4. Exit the System BIOS Setup and save the configuration (F10, F5)
5. Boot the system from the prepared MS-DOS system diskette
6. Start the utility FLASHBIO.EXE to save the old image
   FLASHBIO <file name>   (example: FLASHBIO bios100.omf)
   This saves the old BIOS and the contents of the CMOS-RAM on the
   diskette.

7. Insert the Flash Update Diskette with the new BIOS and start the PC.
   The PC will boot from diskette, start the AUTOEXEC.BAT-file and update the
   system.
   Messages and hints will be displayed on the screen during the update
   process.
  
  
IRQ-Setting
-----------
The behavior you have desribed is ok. But this needs some explanations.

There is an ASIC ("CLASIC") and additional logic implemented in the PCE-5S 
hardware that is used for redirecting the IRQ's.
The ASIC and logic also alow to use shared or splitted interrupts.
If the same IRQ is selected for each SCSI-controller, shared interrupts are
used.
The standard PC harddisk-controller IRQ14 is handled different from the 
other available interrupts.
This is due to the fact that some standard operating systems try to use there
own drivers if they detect that IRQ14 is used. This causes problems because
SCSI controllers are different that standard harddisk controllers.


The following diagram shows how interrupt requests are redirected in the 
PCE-5S:
                         

IRQ, SCSI 2                -------------------------         -------

                    |      -------------------------        |   R   |

                    |                                 IRQ15 |   T   |

  |                                                         |   I   |
  |                                                         |   C   |
  |   IRQ, SCSI 1          -------------------------        |       |
--.-----------------------| config register 0B      |-------|       |
      base address        |                         | IRQ10 |       |
      840H                 -------------------------  IRQ11  -------
                                                      IRQ15


The IRQ from SCSI controller 2 is connected to the config register 09H and 0AH.
Config register 09H is the IDE config register and allows to route
IRQ14 and IRQ15 as well to enable the inputs.
Config register 0AH allows to root IRQ 10, 11, 15.
Config register 0BH allows to root IRQ 10, 11, 15 but  n o t  IRQ14.

Because we do not want to waste IRQ14 we are using a trick.

If the user selects IRQ14 for SCSI controller 1, this interrupt is routed
through config register 09H (Controller 1 only). SCSI Controller 2 is 
disabled.
If Controller 1 and 2 (CTRLR 1 / CTRLR 2) and IRQ14 and IRQ15 are selected the
IRQ's are switched. For controller 2 IRQ14 is used, for controller 1 IRQ15 
is used.
This has no impact to the user.
The above situation describes the situation you have found.
This is only valid if the user uses IRQ14.
Our default selection is
  Controller 1 = IRQ11
  Controller 2 = IRQ15

If other combination of the IRQ's are used (IRQ10/IRQ11/IRQ15) the
interrupts can be routed by the config register 0AH and 0BH and there 
is no need for a switch.

To handle that situation with the switched IRQ14 in your driver, I recommend
to read the Peripheral Control2 register (offset 29H) in the CMOS RAM
to get the info that IRQ14 is selected for Controller 1 and another
interrupt request for Controller 2. 

I hope that explaination helps to understand the situation with the IRQ's.

I am looking forward hearing from you soon.

Sincerely
Erhard Weiss
