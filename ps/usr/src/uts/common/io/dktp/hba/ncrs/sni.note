Dear Bruce Adler,

I have received your mail. Here are the requested infos.

I have checked the programming of the 53C710 register. 
The bits EVP, EPG and GRP are set correct. In addition the bit EPC should be
set.
Here is a complete summary of the bits used:

SNTL0:  EPC (enable parity checking) = 1
        EPG (Enable partity generation/parity through) = 0

CTEST7: EVP (even parity) = 1

CTEST0: GRP (generate receive parity for pass through) = 1


Technical description
---------------------
The odd parity of the SCSI bus in converted to even parity used for our 
private 64 bit bus. The SCSI controller is responsible for generating the
parity. This feature is available till Rev D of the SCSI controller
53C710.


We do not plan to change anything in the hardware. The hardware is frozen.

I have discovered that the System BIOS that includes the SCSI BIOS (old name:
CAMcore) is relatively old.
The current version is: V1.00 / Rel 1.04.714
That System BIOS includes a SCSI-BIOS V3.00.08.

I will send you the new BIOS via mail. The BIOS can be flashed easily by 
using the utility on the "Flash Update Boot Diskette".

To flash the new BIOS 2 methods are possible:

1. Boot the PCE-5S
   Insert the BIOS Update Diskette
   Run the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   The new BIOS will be flashed, several hints will be displayed on the 
   screen.

2. Use of the Recovery Mode
   Open the PCE-5S
   Close the switch S1 of the DIP switch located on the motherboard
   Boot the PCE-5S with the Flash Boot Diskette inserted
   Some infos will be displayed on the LCD display
   After the update process is finished, remove the diskette
   Turn the PCE-5S off
   Open the switch S1
